=====================

##Background

The iOS 7 status bar looks great, but it can be frustrating how text inside scroll views can now very easily clash with the text in the status bar. Take Google Maps for example:

##DCLabelFadeScrollView

`DCLabelFadeScrollView` is a subclass of `UIScrollView` which fades out any instances of `UILabel` subviews as they pass underneath the status bar area.
